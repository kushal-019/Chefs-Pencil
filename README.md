## Code Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the game structure.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the game interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic.

## Example Code

Here’s a snippet of how the game logic is implemented in `script.js`:

```javascript
const statements = [
    { truth1: "I have been to Paris.", truth2: "I can speak Spanish.", lie: "I have a pet elephant." },
    { truth1: "I love pizza.", truth2: "I have visited 10 countries.", lie: "I am an astronaut." },
    // Add more sets of statements here
];

function getRandomStatements() {
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * statements.length);
    return statements[randomIndex];
}

// Function to handle user choices and check if they are correct
function checkAnswer(selectedStatement) {
    // Implement logic to check if the selected statement is the lie
}
```
