export  const paragraph  = "Samantha always dreamed of exploring the world, and at 16, she finally began her adventure. Her first stop was Japan, where she marveled at the cherry blossoms in Kyoto and enjoyed sushi that was far fresher than any she had ever tasted. While in Japan, she visited Tokyo and climbed Mount Fuji, an experience she described as both challenging and exhilarating. Samantha's love for nature also led her to New Zealand, where she went bungee jumping off the Kawarau Bridge and trekked through the lush landscapes of Fiordland National Park. During her travels, she made it a point to experience local cultures, learning basic phrases in each language and participating in traditional festivals. In Australia, she explored the Great Barrier Reef and spent a few days on a remote island where she snorkeled among vibrant coral reefs and swam with sea turtles. Samantha's travels weren't without mishaps; she once got lost in the bustling streets of Bangkok but managed to find her way back with the help of a friendly local. She also encountered an unexpected snowstorm in Sweden, which she had never experienced before. Through her adventures, Samantha developed a deep appreciation for diverse cultures and the beauty of the natural world, making memories that she would cherish for a lifetime."
